Training Only on Good Personas: Preventing the Emergence of Harmful Behaviors in LLMs

## Research Question

Can large language models (LLMs) be fundamentally safer by design if they are only ever trained on "good personas"? How can we structurally prevent harmful personas during pretraining rather than suppressing them post-training?

## Background

Current safety methods typically suppress harmful behaviors after pretraining, but these personas remain latent and can sometimes be reactivated through adversarial prompts or fine-tuning. By contrast, restricting pretraining to prosocial, constructive personas may prevent the very formation of harmful modes, making them impossible to activate at inference time.

Traditional approaches focus on post-hoc alignment techniques like RLHF, but these methods don't eliminate the underlying capability to produce harmful outputsâ€”they merely suppress it. This creates ongoing vulnerabilities where adversarial prompts, jailbreaks, or fine-tuning can resurface these latent harmful behaviors.

## Proposed Approach

This research explores persona-constrained pretraining as a structural safety approach:

1. **Define "Good Personas"**: Establish criteria for identifying prosocial, constructive personas in training data
2. **Data Filtering at Scale**: Develop novel data-filtering methods to curate internet-scale datasets containing only good personas
3. **Pretraining Constraints**: Train models exclusively on filtered data to prevent harmful persona formation
4. **Evaluation Framework**: Analyze whether models trained this way resist adversarial activation of harmful behaviors
5. **Trade-off Analysis**: Examine potential costs in terms of creativity, diversity, robustness, and reasoning about difficult topics

Key investigation areas:

- How to define and filter for "good personas" at internet scale
- Whether such filtering oversanitizes models, limiting beneficial capabilities
- Trade-offs between eliminating harmful behaviors and preserving nuanced reasoning
- Feasibility of structural safety guarantees in future models

## Expected Contributions

- Novel data-filtering methods for persona identification and curation at scale
- Analysis of emergent personas in LLMs and their relationship to training data
- Case studies of failure modes arising from harmful role adoption
- Philosophical framework for defining "good persona" in context of AI safety
- Empirical evaluation of persona-constrained models vs traditional approaches
- Understanding of trade-offs between safety, capability, and robustness
- Foundation for structural safety guarantees in future LLM development

This interdisciplinary approach brings together machine learning, alignment research, ethics, cognitive science, data curation, and social sciences to chart a path toward safer, more reliable AI systems through preventive design rather than reactive suppression.
