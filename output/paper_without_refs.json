It demonstrates the importance of strong assumptions and the development of efficient factoring algorithms. The paper's main contribution is the development of the Double-D_{1} algorithm, which is a more efficient version of the Double-D_{2} algorithm. The paper also introduces the concept of \"weak\" algorithms, which are algorithms that can be significantly sped up by assuming the prime number is close in size to a power of small prime numbers. The paper shows that under this assumption, a more efficient algorithm can be developed, which is particularly useful for factoring large prime numbers. The paper's main contribution is the development of the Double-D_{1} algorithm, which is a more efficient version of the Double-D_{2} and the D_{6} algorithm.\n\n* The paper presents the Double-D_{1} algorithm, which is a more efficient version of the Double-D_{ 2} algorithm. The Double-D_{1} algorithm is designed to be more efficient than the Double 2 algorithm, which is considered inefficient for large prime number factorization. The Double-D_{1} is a state-transition Machine, designed to take advantage of the fact that the prime number is close in size to a power of small prime numbers. The Double-D_{1} algorithm is a state-transition Machine, designed to take advantage of the fact that the prime number is close in size to a 5n+3, a 6n+5, a 7n+2, or a 4n+7, for some small n. The Double-D_{ 2} algorithm is considered inefficient for large prime number factorization, because it doesn.
