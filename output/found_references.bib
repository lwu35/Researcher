  year={2025},
  abstract={Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how persuasion and bias interact in LLMs,...},

There is ample work on aligning LLMs with human ethics and preferences, including data filtering in pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and red teaming, etc. In this study, we discover that chat in cipher can bypass the safety alignment techniques of LLMs, which are mainly conducted in natural languages.

Previous work has explored robust text prompts through adversarial training, achieving some improvement in both robustness and generalization. However, they primarily rely on singlegradient direction perturbations (e.g., PGD) to generate AEs, which lack diversity, resulting in limited improvement in adversarial robustness.

  abstract={Despite inheriting security measures from underlying language models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) may still be vulnerable to safety alignment issues. Through empirical analysis, we uncover two critical findings: scenario- matched images can significantly amplify harmful outputs, and contrary to common assumptions in gradient-based attacks, minimal loss values do not guarantee optimal attack effectiveness. Building on these insights, we introduce MLAI (Multi-Loss Adversarial Images), a novel ja...},
