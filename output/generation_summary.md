**Title:** Leveraging Adversarial Personas to Enhance the Safety of Large Language Models



**Abstract:**

Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT or Llama, has become an important issue. However, most work has focused on latent and active attempts to produce harmful content, often in the context of jailbreak attacks. This work will propose a way to increase the diversity of personas, particularly those related to power, to use in adversarial training, and a way to adversarially influence Llama2. The paper also introduces a more realistic benchmark dataset for controlling and measuring harmful content in chatbots.


**Motivation:**


The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has brought significant capabilities but also the challenge of ensuring safety in various applications. Traditional adversarial attacks on LLMs have been limited to specific scenarios, such as jailbreak attempts and harmful content generation, and often involve subversive personas. Existing benchmarks and attack methods have not adequately addressed the need for more nuanced and realistic evaluations, particularly in controlling and measuri...
